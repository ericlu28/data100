    "## This Assignment\n",
    "In this homework, you will use what you've learned in class to create a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data\n",
    "- Using `sklearn` libraries to process data and fit models\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting\n",
    "- Generating and analyzing precision-recall curves\n",
    "\n",
    "## Warning\n",
    "This is a **real world** dataset – the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these innapropriate emails, and wanted to give a warning at the beginning of the homework so that you are made aware."
